Early warning systems for Glacial Lake Outburst Floods (GLOFs) are designed to detect and provide timely alerts about potential flooding events caused by the sudden release of water from glacial lakes. These systems typically include a combination of remote sensing, ground-based sensors (like water level gauges, weather stations, and seismic instruments), data modeling, and communication networks to predict and monitor lake conditions.
